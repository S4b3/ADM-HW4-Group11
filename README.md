Welcome to our fourth homework repository!

A better visualization of our notebook can be found [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/S4b3/ADM-HW4-Group11/blob/main/main.ipynb).

If you want to run the notebook make sure to see if you have installed all the libraries we used.

For better comprehension we have extracted most of the functions we coded inside these modules:

- [./audio_signals_utils.py](https://github.com/S4b3/ADM-HW4-Group11/blob/main/audio_signals_utils.py)    
- [./hash_utils.py](https://github.com/S4b3/ADM-HW4-Group11/blob/main/hash_utils.py)    
- [./lsh_utils.py](https://github.com/S4b3/ADM-HW4-Group11/blob/main/lsh_utils.py)    
- [./functions.py](inserisci link qui)    

Every module has been documented, so feel free to read the documentation to understand the code more easily.

During our work, in order to resume working from "checkpoints", we've extracted some of the data into different files, like:
- `./permutation_seed.txt`   
random seed usable for replicability of our work
- `./data/bucketsDictionary.json`    
dictionary that maps our lsh matrix buckets into the corresponding songs
- `./data/dataSignatures.json`   
dictionary containing minHash signatures for our dataset
- `./data/signature_mat.csv`   
minHash signature matrix of our dataset
- `./query/querySignatures.json`   
dictionary containing minHash signatures of our query set
